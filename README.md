# snake-game

If you would like to play the snake game I programmed, do the following:

1. Download my repository as a zip file.
1. Unzip the file.
1. Go to the ```build/libs``` folder.
1. Here you will see a file named ```SnakeGame-1.0-SNAPSHOT-all.jar```
1. Double click that .jar file and the game will start running!
